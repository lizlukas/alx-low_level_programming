A linked list is a non-sequential collection of data items. It is a dynamic data structure. 
For every data item in a linked list, there is an associated pointer that would give the 
memory location of the next data item in the linked list.
The data items in the linked list are not in consecutive memory locations. They may be 
anywhere, but the accessing of these data items is easier as each data item contains 
the address of the next data item.
Advantages of linked lists:
Linked lists have many advantages. Some of the very important advantages are:
1. Linked lists are dynamic data structures. i.e., they can grow or shrink during 
the execution of a program.
2. Linked lists have efficient memory utilization. Here, memory is not preallocated. Memory is allocated whenever it is required and it is de-allocated 
(removed) when it is no longer needed.
3. Insertion and Deletions are easier and efficient. Linked lists provide flexibility 
in inserting a data item at a specified position and deletion of the data item 
from the given position.
4. Many complex applications can be easily carried out with linked lists.
Disadvantages of linked lists:
1. It consumes more space because every node requires a additional pointer to 
store address of the next node.
2. Searching a particular element in list is difficult and also time consuming.
3.2. Types of Linked Lists:
Basically we can put linked lists into the following four items:
1. Single Linked List
2. Double Linked List.
3. Circular Linked List.
4. Circular Double Linked List.
