Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result
& (And operator)
The & operator takes two equal-length bit patterns as parameters. The two bit integers are compared. If the bits in the compared positions of the bit patterns are 1, then the resulting bit is 1. If not, it is 0.

For example; take two bit values X
X
 and Y
Y
, where X= 10 = (1010)_2
X=10=(1010) 
2
​
 
 , and Y = 9 = (1001)_2
Y=9=(1001) 
2
​
 
, let’s attempt to find X
X
 & Y
Y
.
 (Or operator)
The | operator takes two equal-length bit patterns as parameters, if both bits in the compared position are 0, the resulting bit is zero. If not, it is 1.

For example: take two bits X
X
 and Y
Y
, where X = 10 = (1010)_2
X=10=(1010) 
2
​
 
 , and Y = 9 = (1001)_2
Y=9=(1001) 
2
​
 
, let’s attempt to find X | Y
X∣Y
